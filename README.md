Notes:  
About as barebones as you can possibly get.  Enhancements and optimisations coming in future versions.

How to use:  
Drop a bmap on Breckfest.exe to get a png file.  
Drop a png (dds, tga and tif also supported) on Breckfest.exe to get a bmap file.  
Image to BMAP will add a ".x" to the filename (ie Skin5_C5.png would become Skin5_C5.x.bmap), this is to prevent accidentally overwriting of original files. You'll need to rename the files manually and remove the ".x"

**Changelog**

v1.1.0  
Name change!  Breckfest looks less broken than Breakfest.  
Added support for DDS, TGA and TIF files  
Increased maximum supported image size to 8192x8192.  This takes bloomin' ages to squish.
